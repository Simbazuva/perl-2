'blue' #Keeps a string of 4 characters  and the '' give the beginning and ending of a string.
'' # No characters so null strings

"blue" #The same as in 'blue'. Double quote allows special \ controls to be able to be used.

"how" . " quaint" # same as "how quaint". The concatentation ( the . between the strings) can do fuse strings.
"power" x 5 # this multiplies the string by how much. You can do math here and it will work.
