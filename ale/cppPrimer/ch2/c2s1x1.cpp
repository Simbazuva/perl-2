//Exercises on Section 2.1.2

/* Exercise 2.1: The all present integer values but in difference sizes
   int - 32 bit
   long - 64 bit (depending on the arch of the machine, this number could be the same as int)
   short - 16 bit
   */

/* Exercise 2.2: Integral types used these.
    unsigned: Unsigned means that the value has to be positive or 0. Basically [positive number >= 0]
    signed: Literally what the word means, a positive or negative number (zero counts as well). [-negative number, positive number]
    */

/* Exercise 2.3: If a short is given on a machine that counts it as a 16bit, then the largest number you could give a short is:
    from [-255,255] with a signed 16bit or a [0,511] for an unsigned.
    */

/* Exercise 2.4: The value would be on an usigned short, 195.69471 for 100,000. As for plain 16 bit short is -134.
  */

/* Exercise 2.5: The difference between a float and a double is:
   a float is a floating-point usually referring to a word or 32 bit and a double refers to a two word or a 64 bit.

   The size determines significant digits the value may have.

/* Exercise 2.6:



#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
