/* Exercise 4.3
 * a) legal, everything initiliazed.
 * b) illegal, not an array, so can't initialize.
 * c) can't copy an array to another array like vectors.
 * d) SERIOUSLY wrong, can't coppy a vector to an array.
 */

/* Exercise 4.4
 * Easier to define the array first like
 * int bob[4]; // Then give it the elements.
 * int bob[1] = 13;
 */

/* Exercise 4.5
 * Just bad all arround. The only good thing is that they are fast, and when you need speed, a vector might not cut it.
