// Exercise 2.14 in 2.3.2

/* Exercise 2.14:
   a) int double = 3.14159 <----- correct
   b) char _ <----- wrong, can't have just a simple underscore as an identifier
   c) bool catch-22 <----- wrong, can't have a - to signifiy a variable
   d) char 1_or_2 = "1" <----- wrong, can't have an integer as a char with an underscore beginning.
   e) float FLOAT = 3.14f <---- correct, but confusing as fuck.
