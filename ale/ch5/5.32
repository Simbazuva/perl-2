// Exercise 5.{32,33} from section 5.12.7

/* Exercise 5.32
 * a) no conversion, unless if you count a being presented 3 times.
 * b) ival is multiplied by itself and the 1.0 is changed to an int then subtracted to a unsigned which turns into w/e then finally converted to a float.
 * c) fval converts to unsigned which then converts to a double val.
 * d) dval and float get along fine, int converts the result, then the number is presented as a char.
 */

/* Exercise 5.33
 * a) pv = const_cast<string*>(ps);
 * b) ival = static_cast<int> (*pc);
 * c) pv = static_cast<void*>(&dval);
 * d) pc = static_cast<char*>(pv);
