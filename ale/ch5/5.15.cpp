// Exercise 5.{15-16} for section 5.5

/* Exercise 5.15
 * prefix only increments the left hand.
 * postfix increments the right hand and keeps a copy of the old value
 */

/* Exercise 5.16
 * because it wanted to show that it can keep the original value of c plus make changes to it :)
 */

/* Exercise 5.17
 * then it would give an error since it would try to add both pointers together.
